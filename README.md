# Event Scheduler Project

## Overview

This project is an **Event Scheduler** web application built using **Spring Boot** for the backend and **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript** for the frontend (basic design). The application aims to allow users to create, view, edit, and delete events, as well as invite users to events. It also includes user authentication and the ability to manage invitations.

### Features Implemented:
1. **User Registration & Login**:
   - Users can register with their email, username, and password.
   - User accounts are managed via the backend, using **Spring Boot** and a **MySQL database**.

2. **Event Management**:
   - Users can create events with details such as title, location, date, and description.
   - Users can view, edit, or delete their events.

3. **User Invitations**:
   - Event creators can invite users to their events through invitations.
   - Users can accept or decline invitations.

4. **AI-Generated Event Descriptions**:
   - The event descriptions are automatically generated by an AI service, enhancing the user experience by providing better content for events.

5. **RESTful Endpoints**:
   - The backend is powered by **Spring Boot**, and provides endpoints for:
     - User registration and authentication.
     - Event CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations.
     - Invitation management (invite, accept, decline).
     - Event search with filters (title, location, date range).

## Limitations and Future Work

### Frontend:
Due to my current experience limitations, the frontend for this application is **not fully functional** and only provides basic functionality for interacting with the backend. The UI is basic and does not include features like proper form validation, dynamic page updates, or real-time user interaction. The frontend needs further development for a better user experience.

### AI-Generated Descriptions:
I integrated a simple AI-based feature to auto-generate descriptions for events. The descriptions were generated using a basic AI model, allowing the event creator to get better event descriptions without needing to input them manually.

### What Was Supposed to Be Included:
- A more polished **frontend** with a rich user interface, form validation, and interactive elements.
- The **ability to send reminders** to users who are invited or have events coming up.
- **Real-time notifications** when an event is created, updated, or a user is invited.
- **User profile management** for users to update their personal information, change passwords, and manage their events and invitations.

## How the Project Was Supposed to Work:

1. **User Registration**:
   - A user can register with their email, username, and password. Upon successful registration, the user is redirected to the login page.

2. **User Login**:
   - Once a user is registered, they can log in using their credentials to access the system and manage events and invitations.

3. **Creating Events**:
   - After logging in, the user can create an event by entering event details such as title, description, date, time, and location.

4. **Managing Events**:
   - Users can view, update, or delete events they created.

5. **Inviting Users to Events**:
   - Event creators can send invitations to other users, allowing them to attend the event.
   - Invitations can be accepted or declined by the invited users.

6. **Searching Events**:
   - Users can search events by title, location, or a date range (start and end dates) to find events that match their interests.

7. **Invitation Management**:
   - Users can accept or decline invitations they receive for events they were invited to.
